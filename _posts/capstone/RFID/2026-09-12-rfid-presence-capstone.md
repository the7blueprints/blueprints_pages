Tardiness, restroom breaks, counseling visits, and early departures all get flattened into a single present/absent mark, hiding how much instructional time a student actually gets.</td></tr><tr><td>Our Approach</td><td>Correlate multiple independent presence signals, device via RFID and person via camera, against the bell schedule and per-period enrollment to build a continuous presence model, not just a single daily checkmark.</td></tr><tr><td>Research Question</td><td>Can a low-cost Raspberry Pi&ndash;based UHF RFID system, using tamper-evident computer-mounted tags and doorway detection, reliably establish classroom device presence and contribute to student presence determination when correlated with an existing camera-spatial technology and class registration/bell-schedule data?</td></tr><tr><td>Current Phase</td><td>Phase&nbsp;1, the contact-tap prototype, is working end to end. See <a href="/capstone/rfid-presence/phases/">Phases</a> for the full roadmap.</td></tr><tr><td>Signals Correlated</td><td>RFID (device presence) + Camera (person identity), reconciled against Bell Schedule (attendance window) and Registration (per-period roster).</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>
